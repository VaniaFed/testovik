# Testovik

---

## Overview

Testovik is a project for creating and passing tests, developed during the [Salt & Pepper's](https://snp.agency/ru) internship.

### Two roles

There are two roles to work with:

-   admin that creates and modifies the tests
-   user that passes the tests

You can choose your role during signing up process.

All the routes are protected from unauthorized users, so you need to sign in before either creating or passing tests.

## Home page

When you are logged in, you will see a list of tests to pass, or edit if you are an admin:
